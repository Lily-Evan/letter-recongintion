# 🧠 Letter Recognition using SVM

This project focuses on recognizing handwritten or printed letters using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.  
The dataset contains various features extracted from images of capital English letters (A-Z), and the goal is to accurately classify each letter.

## 📊 Model
- Machine Learning Algorithm: **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- seaborn & matplotlib (for visualization)
- pandas & numpy

## 📈 Results
- Achieved high accuracy in predicting letters
- Visualized performance using a confusion matrix

## 📂 Dataset
- [UCI Letter Recognition Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition)

## 🧪 How to Run
```bash
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the notebook or script
python svm_letter_recognition.py
